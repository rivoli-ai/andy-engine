## üìä Summary Statistics

| Tool | Total Tests | ‚úÖ Passing | ‚ùå Failing | Success Rate |
|------|-------------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **ListDirectory** | 11 | 7 | 4 | 64% |
| **CopyFile** | 17 | 0 | 17 | 0% |
| **DeleteFile** | 15 | 6 | 9 | 40% |
| **MoveFile** | 18 | 2 | 16 | 11% |
| **ReadFile** | 9 | 1 | 8 | 11% |
| **WriteFile** | 10 | 1 | 9 | 10% |
| **TOTAL** | **80** | **17** | **63** | **21%** |

### Key Findings
- **Most Successful Tool:** ListDirectory (64% pass rate) - tool works well for informational operations
- **Most Problematic Tools:** CopyFile (0%), WriteFile (10%), ReadFile (11%), MoveFile (11%) - operations requiring file modifications
- **Common Failure Pattern:** LLM not invoking tools (63% of failures show "Tool was invoked 0 times")
- **Error Handling Issues:** Tests expecting error handling often fail because LLM refuses to call tools with invalid parameters

## üîß Common Issues and Fixes

Based on the test results, here are the most significant issues and recommended solutions:

### Issue 1: Tool Not Invoked (Most Common - ~70% of failures)
**Symptoms:** Test expects tool call, but LLM responds with text explanation instead of invoking the tool
**Affected Tools:** CopyFile (most severe), MoveFile, WriteFile, ReadFile (basic operations)
**Root Cause:** LLM doesn't recognize when to use file system tools, especially for modification operations
**Recommendations:**
1. **Enhance tool descriptions**: Make tool purposes more explicit and add concrete usage examples
2. **Improve system prompts**: Add explicit instructions like "When user asks to copy/move/write files, use the [tool_name] tool"
3. **Add few-shot examples**: Include examples of correct tool usage in the system prompt
4. **Consider prompt engineering**: Test if different phrasing of task descriptions improves tool recognition

### Issue 2: Error Handling Test Failures (~30% of failures)
**Symptoms:** Tests expecting error handling fail because LLM validates parameters before calling tools
**Affected Scenarios:** InvalidPath, MissingParameter, FileNotFound, PathOutsideAllowed tests
**Root Cause:** LLM performs pre-validation and refuses to call tools with obviously invalid parameters
**Philosophical Question:** Is this actually desirable behavior? The LLM is being "smart" by not making calls it knows will fail.
**Recommendations:**
1. **Reconsider test expectations**: Should tests expect attempted tool calls with invalid params, or is validation-before-call acceptable?
2. **Adjust prompts for testing**: Add instructions encouraging "attempt operations even if they might fail"
3. **Separate validation tests**: Create distinct test scenarios for pre-validation vs error-handling behaviors
4. **Document expected behavior**: Clarify in requirements whether validation-before-call is acceptable

### Issue 3: Tool-Specific Problems

#### CopyFile Tool (0% success rate)
- **Most critical failure**: ALL 17 tests fail
- **Primary issue**: LLM rarely invokes copy_file tool even for basic operations
- **Hypothesis**: Tool description may not clearly convey when copying is needed vs other operations
- **Recommendation**: Priority fix - review and rewrite copy_file tool description and examples

#### Modification Tools (Write/Move - 10-11% success rate)
- **Pattern**: Basic modification operations often fail, but specialized operations sometimes work
- **Example**: WriteFile_AppendMode passes but WriteFile_BasicWrite fails
- **Hypothesis**: LLM may not recognize basic file writing as requiring a tool, but recognizes append as special
- **Recommendation**: Emphasize that ALL file modifications require tool calls, even basic writes

#### Read Tool (11% success rate)
- **Pattern**: Line-range reading works, but basic reading fails
- **Hypothesis**: LLM may assume it can access files directly for basic reads
- **Recommendation**: Explicitly state that ALL file access must go through tools, system has no direct file access

### Issue 4: ListDirectory Success Pattern
**Observation:** ListDirectory has 64% success rate - highest of all tools
**What works:** Basic listing, recursive, patterns, sorting, hidden files, max depth
**What fails:** Empty directory, error handling cases, sort descending
**Key insight:** Informational/read operations work better than modification operations
**Hypothesis:** LLM recognizes need for tools when "getting information" but not when "doing things"
**Recommendation:** Use ListDirectory success pattern as template for improving other tools

### Issue 5: DeleteFile Partial Success (40% success rate)
**What works:** Basic deletion, recursive, backups, read-only with force, statistics
**What fails:** Error handling, empty directory, edge cases
**Pattern:** Core functionality works, but edge cases and error scenarios fail
**Recommendation:** DeleteFile tool description provides good baseline - study and replicate for other tools
